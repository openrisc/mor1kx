                    MAROCCHINO Pipeline Goal

  The MAROCCHHINO pipeline is targeted to be a core with performance
level close to ARM Cortex-A8/A9 (operating on the same frequency).

Pursuing the goal the following decisions were made:
  a) The pipeline should consist of the following stages:
    #1 program counter update
    #2 fetch
    #3 decode
    #4 execution (including load/store & l.mt(f)spr processing)
    #5 write back (including interrupts/exception processing here)
  b) The EXECUTION stage should consist of set of pipelined units with
     parallel operation ability for instructions without
     data dependency
  c) The Out-of-Order completion is possible. To restore initial
     instruction order reorder buffer and appropriate control logic
     should be implemented

No support for fancy instructions (DSP/Vector) yet.

  Additionally the configuration options number was restricted.
Currently, the following options are made NOT CONFIGURABLE:

 FEATURE_EXT              == "NONE"
 FEATURE_MAC              == "NONE"
 FEATURE_MULTIPLIER       == "PIPELINED"
 FEATURE_DIVIDER          == "SERIAL"
 OPTION_SHIFTER           == "BARREL"
 FEATURE_ADDC             == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_SRA              == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_ROR              == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_CMOV             == "ENABLED"
 EATURE_FFL1              == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_CUST1            == "NONE"
 FEATURE_CUST2            == "NONE"
 FEATURE_CUST3            == "NONE"
 FEATURE_CUST4            == "NONE"
 FEATURE_CUST5            == "NONE"
 FEATURE_CUST6            == "NONE"
 FEATURE_CUST7            == "NONE"
 FEATURE_CUST8            == "NONE"

 FEATURE_CARRY_FLAG       == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_OVERFLOW         == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_RANGE            == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_DSX              == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_MSYNC            == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_ATOMIC           == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_SYSCALL          == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_TRAP             == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_INSTRUCTIONCACHE == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_IMMU             == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_DATACACHE        == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_DMMU             == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_STORE_BUFFER     == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_FASTCONTEXTS     == "NONE"
 OPTION_RF_NUM_SHADOW_GPR == 0

 FEATURE_PIC              == "ENABLED"
 FEATURE_TIMER            == "ENABLED"

 FEATURE_FPU              == "ENABLED"


  Other options statuses (configurable or not) are not defined yet.


  There are following reasons to make a lot of options are not
configurable:
  a) Simplify design and support testing by reducing configuration
     variants
  b) Simplify source code (as a result of (a)) for already complex
     pipeline
  c) No sense to care a lot about size for such performance pipeline.
     If somebody wants a minimized OR1K core, (s)he should get another
     pipeline implementation (CAPPUCCINO, ESPRESSO or PRONTOESPRESSO)
     and configure it accordingly with his (her) requirements.
